Tidal Wave Gaming Site
=======

Originally used as a demo for the new site, however I will be using this as I continue to add and work on the site. However some features and pages won't be available for security reasons. I hope to add more dynamic content which will involve connecting to databases. Because GitHub is open source and this is a public repo, I will not be publishing those features here for obvious reasons. Everything else that isn't a security threat will be pushed here.
